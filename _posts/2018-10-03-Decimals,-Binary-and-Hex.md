  <tr>
    <td>For this task in particular, I had a slight bit of confusion at the start, as I didn't know that if you copy-pasted some code that referred to a space down a page, the space would change. But apart from that, I managed to complete the code in quite a short space of time. The only thing I could say is that I could have possibly gone further, but I was helping others that did not understand the material.</td>

    <td>From the way this half term has been going, we will probably be doing something different next week. But that topic will probably repeat a lot of this week, with me not quite understanding but eventually getting it and being able to move on, however as I move on with coding in sheets, Iâ€™m getting more of an understanding of the rules of this platform and what can be accomplished.</td>
