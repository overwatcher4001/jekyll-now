  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I didn't even know that you could put code in google sheets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To learn to code a basic Caesar cipher in sheets.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I have reached my target as I have a Caesar cipher coded on sheets</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Before it was explained again, I really didn't know what was actually going on in the code, but afterwards, I could really see what each part did.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>There were some mechanics of coding in sheets that I needed to know before starting, that I made sure I did know, like hoe blanks are ignored.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>After the basic questions were answered, I did not need any help with the rest</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Not much I can say here, my code works and it does what it is meant to do</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>With this topic, I am very much determined to complete it to the best of my ability</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because of the slow start to the lesson, there was a few more columns of potential ciphertext that I could have changed my code to take advantage of  but apart from expanding on my already existing code, there was not a lot I could improve on.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Since I now know the basics of coding sheets, I can jump right into coding next week and complete whatever work we are doing that week. As well as this, I have overall become more familiar with sheets as a whole, not necessarily coding in sheets, but I have made myself more familiar with it in general.</td>
