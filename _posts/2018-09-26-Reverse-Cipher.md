    <td>To create something that decrypts a ciphered message.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target? </th>
    <td>While I did not achieve my target in the lesson, I sort of have for homework</td>

  <tr>
    <th>Persevering</th>
    <td>I did not give up trying after the lesson ended but continued afterwards</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Questioning?</th>
    <td>I had to continually work with my partner and come up with answers to my own questions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Independence</th>
    <td>Although I worked with my partner in the lesson, I did not at home</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Reflecting</th>
    <td>Even though I could not work out how decrypt messages, I have created an alternate solution.</td>

    <th>Engagement</th>
    <td>I was very engaged and determined to make this work.</td>

    <th>What could have gone better in your learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If me and my partner (and ideally some others) had worked together in a better way, and figured out the problems in our way faster, we probably would have come to some code that works in what we were trying to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although we will be doing something different next week, and it is likely that we won't be working with the person next to me, if we are, then I will need to be better at working together with my partner, as that would get important things done quicker and better.</td>
