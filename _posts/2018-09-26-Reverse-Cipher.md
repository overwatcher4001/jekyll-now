    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I have a google sheets that ciphers a given message.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To create something that decrypts a ciphered message.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>While I did not achieve my target in the lesson, I sort of have for homework</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I had to continually work with my partner and come up with answers to my own questions.</td>

    <td>Even though I could not work out how decrypt messages, I have created an alternate solution.</td>

    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I was very engaged and determined to make this work.</td>

    <td>If me and my partner (and ideally some others) had worked together in a better way, and figured out the problems in our way faster, we probably would have come to some code that works in what we were trying to do.</td>

    <td>Although we will be doing something different next week, and it is likely that we won't be working with the person next to me, if we are, then I will need to be better at working together with my partner, as that would get important things done quicker and better.</td>
