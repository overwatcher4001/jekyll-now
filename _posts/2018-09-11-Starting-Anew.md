  <tr>
    <th>How did you use your learning habits this week?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Persevering</th>
    <td>I really had no idea how to add a background image to my blog, even when adding  what I thought worked last time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Questioning?</th>
    <td>This week was mostly just doing things that i've already done, so not much questioning was required</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Independence</th>
    <td>I didn’t ask anyone for help as I had not been working on it for very long as I believed that i didn’t need to bother people yet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Reflecting</th>
    <td>I believed that I have both created a good website and done something new and different</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Engagement</th>
    <td>I have actually very much tried to do something unique this time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What could have gone better in your learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was a bit slow at first when starting a new repository, but after I really started to focus,most things went very well. As well as this, the way that I was supposed to add a picture as a background was more difficult than I remembered, but overall things went well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As I said above, most things that went wrong with  the lesson involved not having a good memory of making a blog last year, but now that all of the core foundations have been completed, I can start focusing  my efforts on equally important, but more difficult, tasks.</td>
